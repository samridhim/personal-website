**Hello World!**,

The graduate school application process was one of the most time consuming, mentally exhaustive periods of my life. In this blog post, I have compiled a list of resources that will help you as much as it helped me, to write a proper application, to select graduate schools based on factors other than "popularity / ranking" among other things.

There are a LOT of blogs already written on this topic. Here is a list of the top ones - 

1. <a href="https://pg.ucsd.edu/" target="_top">Philip Guo's</a> blog covers PhD applications, but he has given real Statement of Purposes written by students who got admitted to work with him.

2. <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-apply-and-get-in-to-graduate-school-in-science-mathematics-engineering-or-computer-science/" target="_top">Matt Might</a> writes about all things graduate school applicants need to know before applying in this blog.

3. <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Memos/Grad-School-Recos/" target="_top">Shriram Krishnamurthi</a> has laid out the fundamentals one should follow while writing Letter of Recommendations. As Indians, we know most of our professors offload that task to us..so this is pretty helpful!

4. <a href="https://medium.com/@vijayc/how-to-pick-a-grad-school-for-a-phd-in-computer-science-a5ce7dceb246" target="_top">Vijay Chidambaram</a> is a System's Professor at UT Austin. He covers all aspects of picking a grad school based on factors like advisor suitability, research match, location, etc. These factors are a LOT more important than the usual "popularity based" ranking that we see on many ranked lists like US News, QS, Times, etc.

5. <a href="https://precog.iiitd.edu.in/graduate-school-faqs.html" target="_top">This</a> blog covers almost all aspects of grad school applications, from an Indian Perspective. Check out the videos mentioned on the bottom with UChicago Prof. Ben Zhao! Very informative.
